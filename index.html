              Clean and simple instant messaging application built with React
              and Firebase. I developed this to learn how to properly handle
              user authentication, and this was a great learning experience for
              the useContext hook as well as giving SASS a proper chance.

              provider.

              Created because I like the UI/UX of Discord, and thought it would
              be fun to replicate the client to practice styling layouts, learn
              proper use of React hooks, and work with React Router.

          Hi there! I'm Colton, a frontend web developer with a passion for
          creating beautiful and user-friendly websites. My journey in
          programming started when I was in middle school creating simple
          scripts in Python and making mods for some games. In college, I would
          make applications to help me with my college algebra homework.
          Although I took a few computer science classes, my studies were
          interrupted by the pandemic in 2020. In 2021, a friend of mine showed
          me a simple React Native app he made in just a few weeks, which
          inspired me to try my hand at web development. I started learning
          React and quickly realized that I needed to get a good foundation, so
          I focused on learning HTML and CSS. I eventually sprinkled in some
          Javascript, then went back to React. Now with over 2 years of
          experience in frontend development, I've honed my skills in a variety
          of areas. I specialize in crafting intuitive user interfaces that
          prioritize the user experience, and I'm always looking for new
          challenges to push my skills to the limit. In addition to my technical
          expertise, I bring a wealth of experience in customer service and
