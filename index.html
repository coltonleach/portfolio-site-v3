              Clean and simple instant messaging application built with React
              and Firebase. I developed this to learn how to properly handle
              user authentication, and this was a great learning experience for
              the useContext hook as well as giving SASS a proper chance.

              Simple forecast app that has four color themes for each stage of
              the day (sunrise, midday, sunset, midnight), with a sun and moon
              for each respective stage. Created to practice working with APIs
              in React, and to get experience with deploying to a serverless
              provider.

              Created because I like the UI/UX of Discord, and thought it would
              be fun to replicate the client to practice styling layouts, learn
              proper use of React hooks, and work with React Router.

        that a great UI/UX is the key to the success of any website. I take a
        user-centric approach to all of my projects, ensuring that the designs I
        create not only look great but also function seamlessly.
