              Here are three websites I created. There's a mock website (Baytown

              and made it full responsive. The clone website was me re-creating
              a friend's Wordpress site in vanilla HTML/CSS/JS in ~4 hours and
              live streamed it.

        Hi there! I'm Colton, a frontend web developer with a passion for
        creating beautiful and user-friendly websites. My journey in programming
        started when I was in middle school creating simple scripts in Python
        and making mods for some games. In college, I would make applications to
        help me with my college algebra homework. Although I took a few computer
        science classes, my studies were interrupted by the pandemic in 2020.
        <br />
        <br />
        In 2021, a friend of mine showed me a simple React Native app he made in
        just a few weeks, which inspired me to try my hand at web development. I
        started learning React and quickly realized that I needed to get a good
        foundation, so I focused on learning HTML and CSS. I eventually
        sprinkled in some Javascript, then went back to React.

        Now with over 2 years of experience in frontend development, I've honed
